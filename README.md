It doesn't matter whether we believe in God or not, but speaking in certain terminology, when Adam and Eve were expelled from Eden, they were alienated from God and from lack of need. A person can get pleasure by closing the emerging needs - in restaurants, sports clubs and nightclubs.

There are no needs without sin; there are no transactions between owners without needs; there are no "transaction —Åosts" by Ronald Coase without transactions; if there are no transaction costs, which is possible thanks to the blockchain, then managers, banks, courts, police, etc. are not needed.
